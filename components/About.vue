      The <span class="font-bold">Significant Activities Map</span> (SAM) is a tool for tracking the latest
      organized crime incidents in Mexico. It was developed in order to keep a record of incidents
      not always thoroughly covered by the press. This being the case, most incidents are sourced
      from social media and not all of them contain complete information.
