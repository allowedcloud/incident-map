      The <span class="text-yellow-500">Significant Activities Map</span> (SAM) is a tool
      to track organized-crime related activities in Mexico. This list is curated by hand,
      with all source links provided on the right of each activity. The majority of primary sources will
      be from social media and supplemented with press sources when applicable. Selecting a month
      under the date tab will filter the list by month.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-8 px-10">
      SAM is built with Vue JS and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can check out the
